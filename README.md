# whot game

A HTML, CSS and Js whot game

## Rules for playing:

Whenever it is your turn, you have to play a card from your set of cards faced towards you by clicking it.
You must play a card that has the same shape or number of the card in the middle. However, there are some exceptions: Special cards. We will check them out later.
If you dont have a card that has the same shape or number, you have to pick a card from the card deck (or Market). The first person to finish their cards is the winner (only if the last card they played is not a Special card).

### Special cards
Special cards are cards with the numbers: 1, 2, 5, 8, 14, or 20. Each of them affect the game

#### card number 1
"Hold on". This gives you an extra turn. This means (as said earlier) you have to play a card with the same shape or number as the card in the middle. Eg, if you play 1-triangle, you must play another triangle card, or another card with number 1 (where you still get another extra turn where you have to play again until you play a card without the number 1)
If, however you don't have a card to play next, simply pick another one from the card deck, the Market

#### card number 2
"Pick 2". This tells the next player (you or the computer) to pick 2. If you drop this card, next player has to pick two from the market OR Defend, meaning play another card with a 2

#### card number 5
"Pick 3". Just like pick 2 but to pick 3 (not 5). The next player also Defends with a card number 5 (not 3)

#### card number 8
"Skip you". The next player's turn is gone, so since you are only two, you have to continue playing. Same behaviour for card number 1, but ONLY because you are two

#### card number 14
"General market". Every body must take a card from the market, then the turn goes back to the player of that card.

#### card number 20
"I want ___". Player must state shape they want after which next player must either play a card with that shape, or go to Market. Whoever plays next must play that shape too. This card can be played on top of any card except card numbers: 2 and 5. Eg if a player drops a 20 asks "I want square" you can also drop a 20 and ask the next player "I want triangle"
